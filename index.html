                is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with d
                esktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                versions of Lorem IpsumC </p>

                Contrary to popular belief,
                Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
                classical Latin literature from 45 BC, maki
                ng it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin pro
                fessor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, co
                nsectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the un
                doubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by 
                Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem 
                ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected hum
                our, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure ther
                necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of mode
                sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks  reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore  always free from repetition, in
                jected humour, or  non-characteristic words etc.</p>
